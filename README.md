# CI-CD Pipeline

## User Story 

AS A USER who is trying to integrate a CI/CD pipeline into a codebase,
<br>
<br>
I WANT an application that runs tests on the develop branch when a PR is made, and then automatically deploys to Render when merged to the main branch,
<br>
<br>
SO THAT I can make sure that all the code passes requirements and also integrates smoothly into the main branch and stays automatically up to date.
